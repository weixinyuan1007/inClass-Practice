## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
libraryData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/library100_102.csv")
```

```{r}
libraryData$學院 <- as.factor(libraryData$學院)
levels(libraryData$學院) -> a
```


```{r cars}
# 0
allBorrowCount <- vector("numeric",18)
for(i in c(1:18)){
  # 1
  a_i <- a[i] 
  # 2
  numericalIndexForSubsample<-which(libraryData$學院==a_i)
  subsample_i <- libraryData[numericalIndexForSubsample,]
  # 3
  borrowCount_i <- nrow(subsample_i)
  # 4
  allBorrowCount[[i]]<-borrowCount_i  
}
```

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
